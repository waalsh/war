;;; Action choice and actions


;; Idea: Strategy is a goal-direction function. It determines whom you
;; should act against and the kind of series of actions you should take,
;; based on your overarching goal.

;; Actions are executions of strategy. They are a computation backbone
;; of strategy, and change states of countries.

;; You can backtrack to a strategy from an action, and once you have a strategy
;; You can intrepolate results, based on your own model. This is how you
;; Determine the characterists of other countries.

;; You can figure our their opinion of you by backtracking from their actions
;; Towards you. 

;; Strategies are directed by your own traits, and the traits of the country
;; You are dealing with. If you know nothing about a country, you will
;; take some default strategy.
