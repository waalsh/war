Deception
=========
All warfare is based on deception. (7)

In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains. (34)

Peace proposals unaccompanied by a swornn covenant indicate a plot. (24)


Intelligence/Spies
==================
- Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success. (34)
